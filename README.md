This repository is the PyTorch source code implementation of 
[Spatiotemporal Multi-view Continual Dictionary Learning with Graph Diffusion](). This is a demo code to illustrate the basic motivation 
for fast training and evaluating the STKR model.

Spatiotemporal unlabeled streaming data acquisitions from different views. This work proposed to leverage label propagation, pairwise ranking and cross-view graph diffusion with view-specific learnable dictionaries to process multi-view data streaming with limited annotation. We leverage the spatial consistent principle of multi-view learning to equalize retentive  intensities among sub-models, enhancing retentive robustness beyond single-view continual learning approaches. 

You can download the data in
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Is9GeVAe9vy1l5xg7Xqwa9lXAYRm3PMu/view?usp=sharing)
and put the downloading file to the root path of the project to evaluate our method.

Thanks for your effort and time to review our paper.
