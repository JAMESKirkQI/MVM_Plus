This repository is the PyTorch source code implementation of 
[Mnemonic Consistency in Semi-supervised Multi-view Continual Learning]() and is 
currently being reviewed in AAAI-2024. This is a demo code to train and evaluate
the Semi-MVAF model on the diverse features (BYOL, SwAV, BiGAN, SDSSL) extracted from the [UIUC-Sports]() dataset.

The full project will be released soon after code integration.

You can download the features in
[BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18kYUbORqliEOWL_hxQUaRA) (password: AAAI).
Please put the downloading file to the root path of the project.

Thanks for your effort and time to review our paper.
