This repository is the PyTorch source code implementation of 
[Contrastive Multi-view Continual Learning]() and is 
currently being reviewed in IJCAI-2024. This is a demo code to illustrate the basic motivation 
for fast training and evaluating the MVKR model. 
The end-to-end MVKR model with diverse views will be released soon.

You can download the data in
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Is9GeVAe9vy1l5xg7Xqwa9lXAYRm3PMu/view?usp=sharing)
 and 
put the downloading file to the root path of the project to evaluate our method.

Thanks for your effort and time to review our paper.
